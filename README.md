# Live Coding Interview Task

During the live coding interview, I was asked to create a simple React component that renders posts retrieved from a free API using Redux and TypeScript.

## Technologies Used
* React
* Redux (RTK)
* TypeScript
* Styled Components

## Requirements
The component should:

Fetch and render a list of posts from the free API.

## Approach
I started by setting up the Redux store and creating the necessary actions and reducers to fetch the posts from the API and store them in the state. Then, I created a React component that connects to the Redux store and renders the list of posts.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
